Things to do (a.k.a. "road map"):
---------------------------------

- tune facets: lok'n'feel is not very good

- add "data from Datanest" disclaimer

- add links to ORSR, Datanest, FOAF, Firemny-Register, etc. from result
  pages

- content of the result pages: Original idea was to have full data in
  Jackrabbit repository. As of now, we're not there yet so we're
  constructing the result pages with data from SOLR which is a hack.
  While Open Data Node is not (yet) pushing out data into Jackrabbit but
  it is pushing data into triplestore we might be able to build
  a front-end on top-of that using Graphity Browser
  (https://github.com/Graphity/graphity-browser) and point there.
  
  This overlaps with "document presentation layer" (see TODO in
  'open-data-node') so ... unify the idea.

- GUI for "advanced search" using SOLR syntax with some "prepared examples"
  (in a form of link: after link is clicked, search term is filled in and
  search results are updated - each field and data type should be covered, like
  "zakladne imanie: from 10 to 100 â‚¬" etc.)
