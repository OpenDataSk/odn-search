Things to do (a.k.a. "road map"):
---------------------------------

- tune facets: lok'n'feel is not very good

- add "data from Datanest" disclaimer

- add links to ORSR, Datanest, FOAF, Firemny-Register, etc. from result
  pages

- content of the result pages: Original idea was to have full data in
  Jackrabbit repository. As of now, we're not there yet so we're
  constructing the result pages with data from SOLR which is a hack.
  While Open Data Node is not (yet) pushing out data into Jackrabbit but
  it is pushing data into triplestore we might be able to build
  a front-end on top-of that using Graphity Browser
  (https://github.com/Graphity/graphity-browser) and point there.
